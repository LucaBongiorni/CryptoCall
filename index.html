          <h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Today's state of the art mobile phone infrastructure like GSM or UMTS impose serious security issues.
  Their design is not intended to support end-to-end encryption while several flaws have been disclosed lately.
  For instance, GSM Wiretapping can be performed with cheap off-the-shelf hardware by everyone with extended technical knowledge.</p>

<p>Our approach overcomes these problems by providing real peer-to-peer communication only relying on already existent infrastructure.
We deploy end-to-end encryption by using a public key method based on OpenPGP.
In our implementation users assign public OpenPGP keyrings to telephone numbers on their mobile device, which can be used to encrypt and authenticate a direct VoIP conversation.
Instead of relying on classic VoIP providers, like Skype, we guarantee permanent peer-to-peer connections between the devices.
The main issue in peer-to-peer communications is the addressing of other devices.
Thus, we use the existing mobile phone numbers as identifiers to exchange public IP addresses and selected ports by utilizing SMS.
Previously proposed VoIP end-to-end encryption rely on a SIP provider to identify other devices, while our approach does not require the creation of other accounts.
Our method utilizes OpenPGP keyrings to establish a TLS connection without relying on central Certificate Authorities.
This TLS connection is used to establish a VoIP session with SIP and SRTP.</p>

<p>Our contribution is a novel solution for the addressing problem of mobile devices for peer-to-peer communications and the application of public key methods in VoIP.
  This includes the widespread OpenPGP standard and its conversion to X.509 compatible formats.
  Our Android application CryptoCall serves as a proof of our concept and is useable by average smartphone users.</p>
